But how did these organizations develop, and what social functions are they expected to fulfil? Why do people collect objects, and how do their collections transform over time, sometimes to become institutionalized as a museum? And why did the cultures and antiquities of ancient Greece and Rome play such a key role in these developments?We will focus on four main themes: 1) the cultural history of London�s museums; 2) the collection and appropriation of classical (Greek and Roman) antiquity; 3) neoclassicism in London; and 4) themes in museum studies, such as education versus entertainment, museum ethics, and museum as theatre.The central location of King's enables easy access to many great cultural institutions. Frequent trips (tour-led or independent) form a key part of this module, and include: the British Museum, the Tate Britain, the Museum of London, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Gallery, with talks by curators where appropriate.  Worksheets are provided for guidance on the weekly independent trips. The organized tours include a 'hands-on' session at the British Museum to handle and draw Greek vases.  Depending on student numbers, the class may be divided into two groups for tours, and a cap of 24 students will be imposed.  No detailed prior knowledge of classical antiquities is required.

They were part of a much broader flourishing of textual production involving merchants, artisans, religious figures, dissidents, and the scribes. A study of this multivalent body of materials sheds light both on the material literary productions of London and on the creation of �London� as a concept that would remain so influential down to our own day.This module will attend to all three of these interconnected topics: the later medieval literature about and indebted to London and its institutions, the textual production of the city�s scriveners, and the notion of �London� that resulted from these two.

This course takes this long theatre history (both in and outside the auditorium), inscribed within the fabric of the urban realm as a starting point for an enquiry into the way that cities and theatre in general, and London and performance in particular, are always braided entities and cannot exist without each others protocols and passions.How does performance theory help us to read the behaviours and relationships of people that make up the city? What are the ways in which configurations of space, power, and movement determine what it is possible to think and feel in the city?

We will do all of this by looking closely at key plays in the Shakespeare canon and at cognate texts by other writers, mostly dramatic, so as both to develop our understanding of the Shakespeare canon and to demonstrate that Shakespeare offers only one of many contemporary ways of addressing Jacobean culture.  In the process we will immerse ourselves in a vibrant literary culture that brings onto the professional stage everything from violence to voyeurism, from witches to widows, from conversion to colonialism, and from silent men to talking dogs.In a given week, we will typically (though not always) look at a well-known Shakespeare play from the latter half of his career � Macbeth, say � alongside other Jacobean plays that address the same or connected issues � in Macbeth�s case, this means �witchcraft plays� such as The Witch of Edmonton and Sophonisba.The overall aim is to build up a comprehensive picture of the context for the second half of Shakespeare�s writing life, of the ways in which the Jacobean stage responded to and constructed the culture it inhabited, of the subjectivities and gender-identities of those whose lives were affected by it, and (building on first semester methodologies work) of the range of ways in which we in the early 21st century might address these matters critically.",MA,One two hour seminar weekly," 1 x 4,000 word essay"

Accompanying these important academic interventions, and in the context of the turbulence on Brixton�s streets explored through Eddie Grant�s 1982 smash-hit song Electric Avenue, a small group of Black artists, activists and teachers founded Black Cultural Archives (BCA). The brainchild of the educationalist and historian Len Garrison, the BCA�s mission ever since has been to record, to preserve and to celebrate the history of people of African and Caribbean descent in Britain.Through an innovative collaborative partnership with the BCA, this module investigates the lived experiences, political activism, forms of cultural production and diverse civic contributions of Black women and men in twentieth-century London. Through a combination of lectures, seminars, and hands-on, source-led exercises � delivered in alternate weeks at KCL and at the BCA in Brixton � students will critique Britain�s imperial past and postcolonial legacies and critically interrogate narratives of migration and multiculturalism that position the arrival of the HMT Empire Windrush as the advent of Black Britain.Themes covered across the module include the mapping of Black spaces in the metropolis, imperial and transatlantic intellectual and cultural networks, anti-racist protest and resistance, and political organisations spanning the West African Students� Union and the League of Coloured Peoples through to the Black Panthers in London and the Organisation for Women of Asian and African Descent.

Street signs and street lights appeared in the City. Housing spread far beyond the old city walls creating new suburbs and industrial areas. Print culture exploded, alongside playhouses. New consumer goods set the fashion across the country. Houses were rebuilt and rearranged.

Subsequent centuries saw several stages of redevelopment of the city as Lundenwic and Lundenburh, ending with its establishment as the English capital. By about AD 1200, London was the kingdom�s pre-eminent economic and governmental centre, and one of the most important cities in Europe.

Major areas of interest include the role of different kings and dynasties in their dealings with London, religion and devotion in medieval London, the development of different areas in and near the city (including Southwark and Westminster), and London as a focal point in its hinterland of southeast England, while close consideration of the city�s changing economic profile is complemented by comparative studies of other contemporary cities in Britain and Europe. Engagement with these issues requires mastery of a wide range of sources, richly catered for in London�s libraries, museums and standing monuments.

How, over time, has the overseas British world presence in Britain been imagined, experienced and embedded? When a trip �Home� came to be seen as a �foreign� influx, how did those individuals and groupings from overseas respond? Why have particular diasporic collectives in London been cast as outsiders and/or burdened with expectations of assimilation? How has reverse colonisation affected Britain �host� culture? To what extent has there been � and is there � a mosaic of distinctive yet cohesive community groups here?Much is known about British migration overseas, but knowledge (particularly comparative knowledge) of the reverse process is sketchy, despite a number of foundational histories in recent years.
